Problems:

Do we count from 0 or 1?
In remove func you have the range as "1 >= index <= list length"
yet, in add func, you say Sheet1 can be removed.
If counting from 0, index(0) is Sheet1, meaning lowest sheet that can be removed is Sheet2?

In add function: 
There's an integer overflow when naming the sheet.
If we keep adding and removing sheets, eventually the next sheet's number will greater than the maximum of whatever type it is.
Then, it overflows to it's minimum number.
e.g. if the type is an int, once it overflows, it goes to "Sheet-2147483648".
Theoretically, we can then keep adding and removing and it will eventually get back to "Sheet1", meaning we could have duplicate sheets names.

In move function:
Out of bounds issue (if counting from 0).
If we move a Sheet to Sheet1 (i.e. index 0), and set the before boolean to true, it will try to move to the index -1.
index -1 is obviously outside the bounds, therefore an issue.
